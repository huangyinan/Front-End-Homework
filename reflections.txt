You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?

1. <strike> & <s> can make a strikethrough --> use <del> instead in the future.
2. <i> vs. <em> : same effect but different use, <i> is for italic and <em> is for emphasis.
3. use <p> to make a paragraph.
* What has been easy?
  
Insert the img:P
* What has been difficult?
  
Configure the margin! First I use <br/> and set width for the horizontal rule, then I thought the task should not be so stupid, so I changed to set width for whole div, but still need one <br/>, feel uncomfortable about this.
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
For this very first project I think it don't need too much problem solving strategies, on the other hand I tried what I thought should work and choose the best one, not only do it to finish this task, but also can learn more.
